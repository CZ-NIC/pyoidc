"""
Settings for oic objects.

.. CAUTION::
    This part is under development.
    Most of the configuration options are being converted from keyword arguments to settings class.
    Using the settings class is optional for now, but will become a necessity later on.

In order to configure some objects in PyOIDC, you need a settings object.
If you need to add some settings, make sure that you settings class inherits from the appropriate class in this module.

The settings make use of `pydantic-settings <https://docs.pydantic.dev/usage/settings/>`_ library.
It is possible to instance them directly or use environment values to fill the settings.
