A Python OpenID Connect implementation
======================================

This is a complete implementation of OpenID Connect as specified in the `OpenID
Connect Core specification`_. And as a side effect, a complete implementation
of OAuth2.0 too.

Please see the `CHANGELOG.md`_ to review the latest changes.

.. _OpenID Connect Core specification: http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html.
.. _CHANGELOG.md: https://github.com/OpenIDC/pyoidc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

Documentation
==============

The `documentation`_ is graciously hosted by `Read the Docs`_. Unfortunately,
the documentation has been largely left unmaintained and `there are various
issues`_. However, the maintainers are trying to remedy this lately with some
new momentum. Please help us by submitting pull requests if you can help
improve the documentation.

Examples
========

Unfortunately, the current examples included in this repository are
unmaintained and `there are many issues`_. We're currently in the process of
creating a working canonical example implementation, however, until that time,
the current examples largely do not work. Please help us by submitting pull
requests that may bring these examples back into a working condition if you
get something working locally.

Acknowledgements
================

Cudos to Vladislav Mladenov and Christian Mainka both at
Horst GÃ¶rtz Institute for IT-Security, Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany
for helping me making the implementation more secure.

Maintainers Needed
==================

If you're interested in helping maintain and improve this package, we're
looking for you! We're working on the project on a best effort basis but we
still maintain a good flow of reviewing each others pull requests and driving
discussions on what should be done. We also use a `mailing list`_ to have long
form discussions.

Please contact one of the current maintainers `@rohe`_, `@tpazderka`_ or `@schlenk`_.

.. _@rohe: https://github.com/rohe/
.. _@tpazderka: https://github.com/tpazderka/
.. _@schlenk: https://github.com/schlenk
.. _mailing list: https://lists.sunet.se/listinfo/pyoidc-dev

Contribute
==========

`Fork the repository`_, clone your copy and `install pipenv`_.

.. _Fork the repository: https://github.com/OpenIDC/pyoidc#fork-destination-box
.. _install pipenv: http://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/advanced.html#fancy-installation-of-pipenv

Then just run:

.. code:: bash

    $ pipenv install --dev

This will not affect your system level Python installation. Please review `our
issues`_ to see what needs working on. Do not hesitate to ask questions if
something is unclear. We mark easy issues as `newcomer-friendly`_, so they are
a good place to start if you want to contribute.
