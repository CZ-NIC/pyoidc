A Python OpenID Connect implementation
======================================

This is a complete implementation of OpenID Connect as specified in the `OpenID
Connect Core specification`_. And as a side effect, a complete implementation
of OAuth2.0 too.

.. _OpenID Connect Core specification: http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html.

Documentation
==============

The `documentation`_ is graciously hosted by `Read the Docs`_. Unfortunately,
the documentation has been largely left unmaintained and `there are various
issues`_. However, the maintainers are trying to remedy this lately with some
new momentum. Please help us by submitting pull requests if you can help
improve the documentation.

Examples
========

Unfortunately, the current examples included in this repository are
unmaintained and `there are many issues`_. We're currently in the process of
creating a working canonical example implementation, however, until that time,
the current examples largely do not work. Please help us by submitting pull
requests that may bring these examples back into a working condition if you
get something working locally.

Acknowledgements
================

Cudos to Vladislav Mladenov and Christian Mainka both at
Horst GÃ¶rtz Institute for IT-Security, Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany
for helping me making the implementation more secure.
