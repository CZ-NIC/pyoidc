                       OpenID Connect Federation
                       draft-hedberg-oidc-fed-01

Abstract

   The OpenID Connect standard specifies how a Relying Party (RP) can
   discover metadata about an OpenID Provider (OP), and then register to
   obtain client credentials.  During registration, the RP provides
   metadata about its services.  There is no automated mechanism for the
   OP or the RP to verify the information exchanged during this process.
   All the information is self-asserted.

   This document describes how a trusted third party can enhance the
   security between the OP and RP by providing additional integrity
   about their respective metadata.  Using this approach, an attacker
   would have to obtain the private keys of the trusted third party,
   which would mitigate the risk of a compromised SSL connection.

1.  Introduction

   The original specification of OpenID Connect defines how a Relaying
   Party and an OpenID Connect Provider dynamically can exchange
   information necessary for successful communication.

   One problem with using dynamic discovery and registration is that the
   information that is exchanged can not be easily verified as it is
   self-asserted.

   Software statements, as introduced by RFC 7591, is a possible choice
   for transferring verified data and trust in the data by using a
   trusted third party (that verifies and enforces some common policy)
   between clients and servers.

   This document describes how software statements can be used in
   dynamic client registration and provider discovery to transfer
   verified data and to create a trust in the information passed between
   the RP and OP that is independent on the usage of SSL.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described inRFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Trust model

   The trust model is based on chains of trust, linking together signing
   keys, represented asJWK Sets [RFC7517], usingJSON Web Signatures
   [RFC7515].  The signature chain is rooted in the trusted third
   party's signature, and then built upon by the respective entity.  By
   verifying such signature chains, the entities can establish trust in
   the data verified by the trusted third party.

   Handling RP client registration is slightly more complex then dealing
   with OP configuration information and is therefor chosen as an
   example here.  Players:

   o  Federation operator

   o  Developer

   o  Relying Party Admin

3.1.  Federation operator

   The Federation Operator (FO) acting as the trusted third part.  It
   will publish a JWK Set at a HTTPS URL where the server certificate
   MUST appear in a well-known Certificate Transparency log [RFC6962].
   The FO will if the federation policy allows it sign a partial client
   registration request provided by the developer.  The developer will
   make the registration request available at a site where the FO can
   fetch it.  The FO can add claims, representing federation policies,
   to the registration request before signing it.  The signed
   registration request is returned to the developer.

3.2.  Developer

   The developer represents the organization responsible for the relying
   party (RP).  The developer will create a client registration request
   that contains information common to more then one RP.  To the request
   it will add an extra parameter"signed_key", that will contain a JWK
   representation of the public key that corresponds to the private key
   it will use to sign the registration request that the relying part
   admin constructs.

3.3.  Relying Party Admin

   The Relying Party Admin (RPA) is the entity responsible for a
   specific RP.  This entity will construct a client registration
   request containing claims specific to the RP.  To this registration
   request it will add an extra parameter"signed_key", that will contain
   a JWK representation of the public key that corresponds to the

                            Abbreviated Title                   May 2016


   private key it will use to sign the JWK Set that represents the keys
   it will use in the OpenID Connect communication.  The registration
   request will be sent to the developer who will add the by the FO
   signed registration request as a software statement before signing
   the RPs registration request.

3.4.  Signing Key Chain

   The key chain from top to bottom:

   o  the federations key,

   o  the developers key signed by the federation and

   o  the RP's key signed by the developers key

3.5.  Dealing with the OpenID Provider Configuration Information

   It is assumed that an organization will only run one OpenID Connect
   Provider (OP).  We can therefor dispens of the intermediate, the
   developer, from the schema described above.  This leaves us with the
   FO and the OP Admin.  The OP Admin will create a Provider
   configuration and notify the FO about where and when it can be
   fetched.  The Provider configuration is extended with one parameter
   "signed_key" where the OPA will publish the key it will use to sign
   the JWK Set used in the OIDC communication.  The FO will if the
   federation policy allows it sign the Provider Configuration
   information.  The FO can add claims, representing federation
   policies, to the Provider Configuration informaion before signing it.

4.  OpenID Connect communication

   The trust between the entities is established using the above
   described extensions in the first tree steps of the communication
   between an RP and an OP.  How, the RP found the OP in the first place
   is out of scope for this document.

   ------                             ------
   |    | <--- 1) Discovery --------> |    |
   | RP | <--- 2) Registration -----> | OP |
   |    | <--- 3) Authentication ---> |    |
   ------                             ------


   After the discovery and registration is completed a first time, those
   steps SHOULD only be repeated if any changes occur (see notes in
   respective sections below).

4.1.  Extra metadata parameters

   These extra metadata parameters appear in both Provider Configuration
   Discovery and Client Registration:

   signed_jwks_uri
      OPTIONAL.  Location of the entity's signed JWKS, SHOULD return the
      Content-Type "application/jose" to indicate that the JWKS is in
      the form of a JWS using the JWS Compact Serialization.

   signing_key
      OPTIONAL.  A JWS representing the public part of the entity's key.

   software_statements
      OPTIONAL.  A list of software statements.

   software_statement_uris
      OPTIONAL.  A JSON object where the member names are the issuer
      identifiers of the entity that has signed the software statement
      and the values are URLs pointing to the corresponding software
      statements.

   The following is a non-normative example of a RP registration request
   after that the developer has added links to the relevant software
   statements:

     {
       "contacts": ["dev_admin@example.com"],
       "redirect_uris": ["https://example.com/rp2/callback"],
       "application_type": "web",
       "response_types": ["code"],
       "scopes": ["openid", "email", "phone"],
       "signed_jwks_uri": "https://example.com/rp2/jwks.jws",
       "signing_key": {
         "e": "AQAB",
         "kid": "6ISnabkWzVnPELHmJKdUps1kYcXL17dCO6bBAsosjxk",
         "kty": "RSA",
         "n": "sftOcA3_GHxNMjNri40WAnilClJkDXLVukUqKduwd3e_IoMR7kRMcBKuz

     mjwkibm1xhns1VkJQ",
         "use": "sig"
       },
       "software_statement_uris": {
         "https://www.sunet.se/swamid":
             "https://example.com/idfed/swamid.jws",
         "https://www.incommon.org":
             "https://example.com/idfed/incommon.jws"
       }
     }

   For the pairs: software_statements/software_statements_uri and
   signed_metadata/signed_metadata_uri one and only one parameter from
   the pair MUST be present.

   Along the same lines if both "jwks_uri" and "signed_jwks_uri" are
   present, which they might be for backward compatibility reasons, then
   "signed_jwks_uri" SHOULD be preferred.

4.2.  Federation policy

   Any parameters that the federation adds to the software statement
   that also appears in the Provider Configuration response (OpenID
   Connect Discovery 1.0 [OpenID.Discovery] or in a Client Registration
   request (OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0)
   [OpenID.Registration] will override what ever value the same
   parameter has in the transferred metadata.  The only exception is

                            Abbreviated Title                   May 2016


   when the information provided by the RP/OP is a subset of what the
   developer/FO has specified.

5.  Belonging to several federation

5.1.  Developer

   A developer may be a member of more the one federation and the RPs it
   is responsible for may be members of one or more of these.

   This is then how to deal with this.  The developer registers and gets
   metadata signed by each federation.  One extreme is that it will mint
   a new key pair for each federation, the other is that it will use the
   same key pair for all federations.  It really doesn't matter which it
   chooses but the end result must be that there is one signed RP
   registration request per signing key.  This is then published using
   software_statement_uris.

   The following is a non-normative example of an absolutely minimal
   client registration request sent to an OP:

   {
     "redirect_uris": ["https://example.com/rp2/callback"],
     "software_statement_uris": {
       "https://swamid.sunet.se/":
         "https://dev.example.com/rp1/idfed/swamid.jws",
       "https://www.incommon.org":
         "https://dev.example.com/rp1/idfed/incommon.jws"
     }
   }

   Note that redirect_uris has to be present to make it a correct OpenID
   Connect registration request !

   When the OP receives a request like this it will chose which
   federation it will work within and then signal that by only return
   that entry in the software_statement_uris in the registration
   response.

   The following is a non-normative example of an OPs response on the
   client registration request above:

   {
     "client_id": "abcdefgh",
     "client_secret": "0123456789",
     "client_id_issued_at": 1462375583,
     "client_secret_expires_at": 1462379183,
     "redirect_uris": ["https://example.com/rp2/callback"],
     "software_statement_uris": {
       "https://swamid.sunet.se/":
         "https://dev.example.com/rp1/idfed/swamid.jws",
     }
   }

5.2.  OP/AS admin

   An OP may likewise be member of several federations.  As with the
   developer it has the choice of whether it wants one key pair per
   federation or one key pair for everyone or anything in between.  And
   like the RP developer it has to produce one signed metadata statement
   per key used.

   The following is a non-normative example of an OPs response to a
   provider configuration request:

     {
       "issuer": "https://foo.example.org/op/fDTowvP0slEdEAcc",
       "response_types_supported": ["code", "code id_token", "token"],
       "grant_types_supported": ["authorization_code", "implicit",
           "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer"],
       "subject_types_supported": ["pairwise", "public"],
       "id_token_signing_alg_values_supported": ["RS256"],
       "software_statement_uris": {
         "https://swamid.sunet.se/":
           "https://foo.example.org/op/idfed/swamid.jws",
         "https://www.incommon.org":
           "https://foo.example.org/op/idfed/incommon.jws"
         "https://www.switch.ch":
           "https://foo.example.org/op/idfed/switch.jws"
         "https://www.aco.net/":
           "https://foo.example.org/op/idfed/aconet.jws"
     }

   As with client registration requests there are a number of claims
   that has to be present in a Provider Configuration response to make
   it legal.

6.  Verification process

6.1.  OP as receiver

   Upon receiving metadata from an RP what the OP has to do varies
   slightly dependent on whether it has seen an earlier version of the
   metadata or not.  Assuming this is the first time the OP sees
   metadata from the RP this is what it has to do:

   1.  The OP will have to unpack the metadata such that it can get at
       the software statement that is included.  This is the software
       statement that the FO constructed and signed based on input from
       the developer.

   2.  Having the FO's JWK Set it should be able to find a key that can
       be used to verify the signature on the software statement.

   3.  Once it has verified the signature of the software statement it
       can use the signing key included in it to verify the signature of
       the metadata.

   4.  If there is a "signed_jwks_uri" claim in the metadata then when
       it has verified the signature of the metadata it can use the
       signing key included in the metadata to verify the signature on
       the JWK Set it fetched from the URL defined in"signed_jwks_uri".

6.2.  RP as receiver

   It's easier for the RP since there is no intermediate involved in
   producing the signed metadata for the OP.  This means that the RP can
   verify the signature of the metadata using a key in the FOs JWK Set.
   If the OP' metadata contains a "signed_jwks_uri" claim the RP can use
   the signing key included in the metadata to verify the signature of
   the JWK Set found at that URL.

7.  Provider Discovery

   The OP MUST publish its provider metadata as specified by OpenID
   Connect Discovery 1.0 [OpenID.Discovery].  The RP makes a standard
   OpenID Provider Configuration Request.  The OP responds with its
   provider configuration and the additional metadata parameters
   specified above.

8.  Client Registration

   The OP MUST support dynamic client registration as described in
   OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0 [OpenID.Registration].

   The RP makes a Client Registration Request including the additional
   metadata specified above.

                            Abbreviated Title                   May 2016


A.1.8.  Step 8 - OP handles software statement

   The OP fetches the software statement from the URI
   'https://dev.example.com/rp1/idfed/swamid.jws' and then goes about
   unpacking the metadata.  At this point in time the OP doesn't have
   the necessary key to verify the signature of the metadata.  Therefor
   it has to unpack the JWT without verifying the signature.  It will
   then get a JSON document looking like whats listed in step 6 above.
   From this document it can extract the software statement which should
   be signed by a key belonging to the FO.  The OP should have the
   fetched the public version of that key from the FO at some time prior
   to this.  It can now verify the signature of the software statement
   and unpack the JWT.  The JSON document it then gets is the one listed
   in step 3.  The signing key specified in that document can now be
   extracted and used to verify the signature of the metadata.

   What's remaining now for the OP is to put all the pieces of the
   client registration request together.  It will have one piece from
   the developer augmented with the federation policy and then another
   piece from the RP.
